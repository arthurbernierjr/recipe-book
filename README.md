Recipe Book üçΩÔ∏èüçπ

A full-stack Recipe Book featuring Italian & Puerto Rican recipes and adult drinks. This app allows users to create, read, update, and delete recipes, keeping everything organized in a cloud database.

I built this app to combine my love for cooking with learning full-stack development, giving me practical experience with MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and EJS.
